## Overview

Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust (SCITT) is an architecture that supports the ongoing verification of goods and services across end-to-end supply chains where the authenticity of entities, evidence, policy, and artifacts can be assured and the actions of entities can be guaranteed to be authorized, non-repudiable, immutable, and auditable. SCITT is a proposed industry standard, easing the path for uniform data flow across globally distributed supply chains.
