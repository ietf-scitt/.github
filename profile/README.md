## Overview

The Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust (SCITT) initiative is a set of proposed industry standards for managing the compliance of goods and services across end-to-end supply chains. It supports the ongoing verification of goods and services where the authenticity of entities, evidence, policy, and artifacts can be assured and the actions of entities can be guaranteed to be authorized, non-repudiable, immutable, and auditable.
